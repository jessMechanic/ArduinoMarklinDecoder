# espMarklinController

## goal

A cheap opensource decoder for the marklin model trains. based on atmelmega micro controller.

## status 

this is currently in a working condintion but open to implovements
this due to my own circumstances has only be tested on a 60651 Marklin Digital Mobil Station Controller.

## current state
- custom addres
- support for lights, sound and general functions keys.


## future plans
a smaller design of the pcb to give support for a wider support
change pcb design to support other than 5v motors (this can currently be fixed by using a jumper wire from the v-in to a lifted leg of the motor driver)
